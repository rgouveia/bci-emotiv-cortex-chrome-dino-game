# bci-emotiv-cortex-chrome-dino-game

Experimenting with emotiv cortex api to control the dinosaur in chrome (no-internet) game with mental command.
Training the command is the hard part. Best results achieved with just one command trained, not several, and always complementing training with neutral.

A small video, and yes, cheats were in place ;-)
