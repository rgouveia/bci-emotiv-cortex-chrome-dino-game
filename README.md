# bci-emotiv-cortex-chrome-dino-game

A quarantine weekend project... experimenting with Emotiv Cortex API to control the dinosaur in chrome (no-internet) game with a mental command.

It's definitely hard and demands a lot of concentration and training.

Best results achieved with just one command trained, not several, and always complementing training with neutral.

A small video, and yes, cheats were in place ;-)
